# my-dash

Presenting my-dash, the idea behind this project was creating a homescreen for my browser than gave me all the information I needed such as the weather, notes, website bookmarks and a little daily inspirational quote to get me going.

Made using: Reactjs, Tailwindcss, and Firebase on the backend plus a variety of different api's.
